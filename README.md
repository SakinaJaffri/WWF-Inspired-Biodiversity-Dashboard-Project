Built using Tableau Public, this dashboard visualizes global biodiversity trends using real-world conservation data from the Living Planet Index.

## 💡 Project Inspiration
Today, our planet is facing an unprecedented biodiversity crisis. According to WWF’s Living Planet Report, global populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish have declined by an average of **69% since 1970**. Habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and poaching are accelerating these losses at alarming rates.

This project was born from my concern for these issues, and a desire to combine **data analytics** with **conservation awareness**. Through this dashboard, I’ve tried to take a small but meaningful step — transforming real-world data into insights that inform, inspire, and encourage dialogue.

It reflects:
- exploring and communicating patterns through data.
- using data to understand public awareness and behavioral trends.
- turning numbers into nature stories that matter.

## 📦 Datasets Used
**Primary:**
- **Living Planet Index (LPI)** – Real conservation impact data showing species population trends from 1950 to 2020.

**Supplemental (for future expansion):**
- Google Trends
- Charity Navigator Sector Reports
- GlobalGiving Campaign Data

## 🛠️ Tools & Workflow
| Phase | Task | Tools Used |
|-------|------|------------|
| 1. Data Understanding | Explored structure, coverage, nulls | Python (Pandas), Excel |
| 2. Data Cleaning | Removed NaNs, reshaped for Tableau | Python (Google Colab) |
| 3. Insight Planning | Defined key metrics, visual types, and storytelling goals | Done through structured reflection and dashboard storyboarding |
| 4. Dashboard Design | Visualized trends, maps, bars, tables | Tableau Desktop |
| 5. Storytelling Layer | Added filters, narrative, polish | Tableau Dashboard Editor |
| 6. Wrap-up | Documentation and upload to GitHub | Word, Markdown |

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard Overview
**Title:** *The State of Global Biodiversity: Trends, Threats & Hope*

### 🔍 Key Visuals:
1. **Species Trends Over Time (Line Chart)**
   - Avg. population values by year for selected species
   - Filters: Common Name, Country

2. **Global Biodiversity Heatmap (Map)**
   - Country-level population index visualized by color
   - Filters: Year, Region, System

3. **Population by Ecosystem (Bar Chart)**
   - Comparison across Terrestrial, Marine, Freshwater systems
   - Filters: Region, Year

4. **Species Impact Table (Text Table)**
   - Country + species-specific average population index
   - Useful for granular conservation storytelling

## 📈 Insights & Reflections
- Marine systems showed varied, often lower population health
- African regions (e.g., South Africa) had high species tracking but mixed population outcomes
- Line trends helped spot both declines and recoveries (e.g., African Elephant)

## ✅ Ethical Note
This project was created strictly as a **personal learning and portfolio showcase**. All data used is publicly available, and any interpretation, transformation, or visualization of it is my own. While I strive for accuracy and respectful data representation, I welcome suggestions or improvements.

If you're from a conservation or data organization and notice areas of concern or improvement — I’m open to collaboration and feedback.
